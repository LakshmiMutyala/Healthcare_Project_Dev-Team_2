# Healthcare_Project_Dev-Team_2
Hospital Management System (HMS) is a software solution that will help healthcare organizations manage their day-to-day operations more efficiently. This HMS will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and backend like PHP and MySQL hosted in Azure Cloud. The system will provide a range of features and functionalities that make it easier for healthcare professionals to manage patient data, appointments, billing and payments, electronic medical records, reporting and analytics, security, and compliance. By leveraging the latest technologies and following best practices, we aim to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly HMS that supports the goals of your healthcare organization.
